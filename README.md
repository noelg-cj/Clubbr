## How to Run
The project isn't hosted anywhere yet. So, please follow the steps to run the development server.
1. We host the JSON server first (the db.json file).
   **Step 1**: Navigate to `/src/data`.
   **Step 2**:Run `npx json-server --watch db.json`.
2. Now, check the hosted link and paste the base url at `/src/config.js`.
3. Lastly, we host the frontend.
   - Open a new terminal and navigate to the root.
   - Run `npm run dev`
Yay! The server is now running!
